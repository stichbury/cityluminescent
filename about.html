            <p id="about-text">Songlines</p>
            <p>These photographs are taken in and around the Nanjing Road Shanghai during a large part of 2011 and a return trip in 2013. Shanghai is an amazing city, and is transmigrating as it has done so many times in its history. The post-Tokyo Bladerunner neon means pretty much pointing a camera in any direction is going to produce results. I wasn’t looking for this, there exist many amazing photographers that already beautifully capture the sheer futuristic wonder of the place.</p>
<p>Shanghai is a city of high contrast both visually and figuratively.</p>
<p>I was lost spiritually, and emotionally undergoing my own transformations, I found a deep sense of calmness and a strange sense of place walking the streets at night, with a camera and iPod, listening to Fennesz, Sylvian, Karn, Taylor Dupree, Philip Glass and John Foxx, referencing Shanghai born author JG Ballard, and close to living out parts of Geoff Dyers ‘But Beautiful’.</p>
<p>These photographs are closer to field studies or songlines or sorts, than true street photography - I didn’t wish to intrude into people’s space rather capture the drama and life of the place.</p>
<p>Warm thanks to Big Vini, Liwen, Vivi and Madeleine.</p>
